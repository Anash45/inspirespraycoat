 AFTER changing the colour with uPVC spraying 

 ### 1. Change the Colour of UPVC Windows 
 Changing the colour of uPVC windows is a quick and easy way to modernise and update your property.  You can also change the colour of your uPVC doors to match the coloured uPVC windows (or whatever your windows are), thus forming a cohesive look. 

 The method you use to colour your windows and doors will ultimately determine how soon you can transform your property. 
 ### 2. Why are Coloured UPVC Windows and Doors so Popular? 
 UPVC Windows and Doors, Coloured is a hot renovation and one to watch out for in 2023. 

 If you’ve got coloured UPVC Windows and Doors, particularly Grey, you can change the look of your property instantly and bump up its value! And this means that the slightly quirky but hugely effective renovation is already a growing trend and favourite in 2023, and across the UK. 
 ### 3. The Reason for Choosing UPVC Windows with Colour Change Property 
 The reasons you may want to change the colour of uPVC windows or doors are a few and varied. 

 – Your old uPVC is discoloured or faded, or showing wear and tear. 

 In a nutshell, you could just want to update the colour to match your house or style. 

 – You want to increase the value of the property you are selling. 
 ### 4. Choice of Colours 
 You do, when you colour change uPVC windows and doors, have a wide choice of colour swatches, often RAL, Farrow & Ball and Dulux. 

 It’s so you can decide which colour scheme suits your type and style of property. Consulting our team of experts may help you to know the best-trending colours as an example, or help you to match the style of your residential property. 

 We can tell you from experience that grey windows work with every type, every style and every colour of property that we have transformed. 
 ### 5. How to Change the Colour of your Windows and Doors 
 A replacement is unnecessary if your uPVC windows and doors are all in perfect working order and not damaged. 

 This can be coloured in three ways, but you need to bear in mind that these are not all equal as far as longevity or aesthetic value is concerned. 

 In this article, we will walk through all of these methods so you can choose the one that will give you the results and requirements you need. 
 ## 6.3 Ways to get Coloured UPVC Windows and doors 
 ### 1: Coloured UPVC Windows and Doors - Liquid Dip. 

 Air-drying rubber coating that is usually used in the automotive industry is called liquid dip. This can be sprayed directly onto plastics like UPVC and is flexible and peelable. 

 That’s why liquid dip is such a popular choice– you can spray it right from a can onto any plastic surface. 

 It seems especially easy for people who want to do the job themselves – it’s always easier if you mess up and you can just peel off the liquid dip and start again. 

 Liquid dip is touted as a good material, but it is fairly expensive and doesn’t have an attractive finish; it’s rubbery to the touch and looks rubbery. 

 Liquid dip is relatively smooth once professionally applied, and durable but not resistant to abrasion or friction. So for moving features such as windows and doors, it’s not a great option. 

 The kind of build that offers practicality, aesthetics and longevity – there are many much better alternatives. 
 ### 2: Coloured UPVC Windows and Doors - Vinyl Wrap 
 Previously vinyl wrap was used for cars and finally, vinyl wrap for uPVC window frames and windows has become a trend. At first, it looks like a plausible alternative to the uPVC, providing people with a chance to enhance their appearance. 

 Several homeowners came to plenty of wrapping companies for those who wanted to upgrade and colour change their windows and doors. 

 UPVC windows have vinyl wraps coloured in infinite materials with powerful adhesives applied to them. Spray coating them quickly transforms the appearance of a property, with none of the surface preparation or drying time necessary for spray painting. 

 Vinyl Wrap is supplied on rolls but you will need the 3M high-quality stuff that is hundreds per roll! Then you calculate labour cost and wrapping a a window takes about 3 hours or about 4 hours. In turn, to carry out the windows in the house would be about 4 days.

 ### 3:Modern Paint and Spray Painting of UPVC windows and doors. 

 When you have your uPVC window frames, windows and doors sprayed you’re prolonging the life of your existing uPVC. Spray painting will also increase the exterior of the property, and completely change its appearance. 

 Used professionally, high-quality spray paint will create a durable, faultless and even application that your doors and windows will look exactly like the day they were first installed. 

 Additionally, spray paint sticks extremely well to the uPVC or any other surface, and is not impacted or affected by movement or weathering or increased or prolonged use. 

 But to get a flawless, perfect finish, professional painters are a must. Spray painting uPVC isn’t the sort of DIY job you want to attempt unless you’re a professional, as it does require specialist paints and technical equipment. 

 Vinyl wrapping and window replacements are far more expensive than professional spray painting. 

 Professionally sprayed window costs on average about £150, a door about £250. Given with the method of spray painting coloured uPVC windows and doors are not confined to certain colour options. 

 Choose from an array of colours, our charts show an example of the colours available. Now in second place, Jet Black remains despite being overtaken by Anthracite Grey. Anthracite Grey is, by far, the most popular colour choice in 2023 to colour change uPVC windows and doors. In 2021 and 2022 Anthracite Grey was the most popular colour. 

 This is the best, cheapest, strongest and most aesthetic call for the selection if your uPVC doors and windows.

 ### 1. What You Need to Know About Exterior House Painting 
 If it sounds like a contrived expensive lengthy and messy project to paint the exterior wall of your property, stick around because you're about to find out this isn't at all the case. What’s more, you may not necessarily have the time or resources to tackle such a task during your busy day.  

 Why would it make sense to look for someone who does not even know what they are doing in the nose surgery field to do a nose job when professionals do that sort of job? Consequently, most homeowners would seek out a painter/decorator or luxury fit-out specialist when seeking estimates and quotes. 

 Of course, knowing the approximate cost of your home’s exterior painting helps. Factors include the range of; 
* Cost of design and planning 
* Feasible volume of wheat storage capacity 
* Quality of storage infrastructure 
* Impact of storage design on overall cost 
* The size of your property. 
* The condition of the actual surface. 
* Your choice of paint and finish. The amount of repairs and amount of prep time required before painting can begin. 

 And if you’re searching for a rough idea of the type of quote you can find then you’ve arrived. In this post, I’ll be breaking down all of your home’s exterior painting expenses. 
 ### 2. Cost to Paint the Exterior of the House? 
 In truth, a great deal of what you will end up paying will be controlled by the hourly rates of the painters you decide on. Hourly rates can vary hugely depending on the company or people you go to, and where you are. 

 For professional painters, the average charges are somewhere in the region of £20 to £25 per hour. But they will often sell you the rate at £180 to £250 for an entire day, not for an hour. 

 Labour cost isn’t the only factor when it comes to estimating the cost: there may be additional materials and equipment costs including paints, stabilisers, brushes, tape, sand and cement. 

 In some cases, scaffolding will also be necessary. Could hiring the scaffolding set you back £360 a project? 

 After you’ve added up these costs, you should get a good idea as to the price that you can expect to spend while remaining within your budget, requirements, and expectations. 

 No two exterior house painting projects are the same, and it’s essential to keep in mind that the following factors might also add to the cost of your labour and materials: 
* Terraced, semi-detached and detached houses all have different partitions and different costs but paint all of them? When you check your windows and doors you’ll also have to take into account any extensions, porches and conservatories that need repainting if you have them. 
* Preparation and repairs: The entire extent of preparation and repairs before the work starts is very important in attaining a perfect and permanent result. The more you have to pay, however, the more complex any preparations or repairs are. 
* From the type and finish of the paint you require, to how much you’ll need to save up for the paint itself, which varies on how much paint you will need for your house and the number of coats you need. Additionally, some colours and finishes cost more than others. 
 ### 3. Why Paint the Exterior of your Home? 
 Rapidly changing conditions are placed continuously on your property’s exterior components. The exterior walls certainly aren't immune to rain, wind, sunlight, freezing temperatures and humidity. 
 But over time they’ll start to look used and tired. You will be forced to make restorations on a property, so you would have to renovate the property so it will look aesthetically pleasing and maintain its market value. 
 This is because they tend to believe that property renovations are complicated and stressful projects, and as a consequence choosing to delay or defer them. Yet that doesn’t have to be the case. 
 Our experts can professionally paint all of your property’s exterior quickly and cheaply, with incredible results. 
 Often overlooked when considering this major painting project, spray painting is a method.

 ### 4. A Professional Spray Painting Service 
 Painting your property’s exterior can be a daunting task for someone who has never done it before. Pay a professional who can use the correct tool and equipment, along with industry experience handling spray painting exterior house walls, will be much cheaper and considerably faster.

 Before painting, we will clean your property’s walls and get rid of debris, mould or peeling paint from them. It is much faster than brush painting. 

 So starting we apply some of your colour of choice using a quick drying, even colour in a series of layers until we get a flawless finish and perfectly saturated colour.

 As the realm of property management and renovation unfolds at breakneck speed, we are witnessing the powerful impact of the visual attraction and physical stability of a building on its market value as well as the ease with which the building is operational. So for a facility manager, property owner, or a stakeholder who might be looking to renew (not to mention upgrade) their commercial spaces, you are faced with the choice of whether to replace them or rejuvenate existing pieces.

That is why businesses which are looking for operational disruptions can choose Commercial painting contractors as a worthy option for the commercial environment as time is for money and this is why this solution is the best as above described. 
 ### Cost Efficiency - Spray Painting Vs Replacing 
 The economic benefits of commercial spray painting over replacement of fixtures and facades are obvious.

On the contrary, if you decide to enlist the services of the right commercial painting contractors to help you spray paint your property, you will give existing structures new life at a fraction of the costs involved in such projects. 

 Advanced coatings applied on the surfaces using the spray painting process help increase the durability and resilience of the surface.

 ### Adding Value with Strategic Colour Selection 
 Sometimes a fresh coat of paint can have an aesthetic transformation which can take a property from drab to fab, and thus increase property value. Commercial spray painting offers endless colour and finish options, meaning that property owners can match the colour and finishes of the exterior of their premises to the most recent design trends, brand identity or functional requirements. 

 Choosing a colour refresh can revolutionise a property making its exterior or interior ambience more inviting for clients and customers. This not only increases the property’s marketability but also can help create a professional and, hopefully, good brand image and positive customer perception. 
 ### Sustainability and Efficiency 
 It’s also important to consider when renovating and that is the environmental aspect of it. Today, many commercial painting contractors have a greener alternative in mind, minimizing waste and conserving resources toward a replacement. This way is also in line with the sustainable development goals and can be employed to enhance a company’s environmental stewardship as perceived by clients and the public. 

 In addition, the speed of spray painting makes projects quicker, diminishing accumulated interruptions for organizations. It is particularly important to commercial entities where sustained disruptions can result in operational loss and annoyance.

This article will give insights into how decorators are combining both to create impactful designs in residential and commercial spaces.",content:`![](/assets/up-window.png) 

 ### 1. Why is UPVC so Popular 
 uPVC boasts durable and thermally efficient credentials and when compared to other materials it is the preferred choice for both domestic and commercial properties. 

 Besides being an inexpensive, low-maintenance and efficient insulator, it can be formed in a variety of colours and finishes. 

 Cosmetically, there are several ways to improve uPVC windows, with two obvious ways being spraying painting or vinyl wrapping. 

 These each yield a different result, but when it comes to longevity, aesthetics and application spray painting is superior by far. 

 In the next article, we will evaluate the pros and cons of each of these methods. Moreover, we are also showing why spray painting is not only much cheaper, longer lasting and more convenient but can be done in a faster manner and in less cost than window wrapping. 
 ### 2. Can You Wrap UPVC Windows? 
 Before, cars saw vinyl wrap but recently, vinyl wrap was used for uPVC window frames and windows as a trend. 

 On the face of it, it looks like a legitimate option for making uPVC look better. Homeowners who wish to improve their doors and windows have sought their services from many wrapping companies. 

 uPVC windows are covered with Vinyl wraps in sheer powerful adhesives with numerous colours. These are designed to initially transform a property’s physical appearance with little (if any) surface prop… 

 Refurbishing any part of your house is a very expensive investment, of course. However, vinyl wrapping solutions aren’t at all what you’d expect out of a large-scale renovation project. 
 ### 3. Is Window Wrapping a Good Idea?​ 
 The problem with vinyl wrapping is that the process is a very expensive service and the vinyl material does not even last more than five years. In Comparison with other methods, it is only good as a short-term remedy to alter the appearance of the UPVC windows. 

 As it is with other car types, the vinyl wrap does not stick very well on UPVC surfaces even when there is the use of adhesives. Over a period water will accumulate at a point below the outer layer and rise off the new UPVC surface. 

 This causes one of the following situations, either the vinyl wrap or the foil-covered UPVC windows will have to be substituted. This is far from ideal if done every five years because any home renovation of any kind is a process that is both time-consuming and costly. 

 As a customer, you wish to have a guarantee that any work done to your property will last for as long as it is possible before the house will require the next round of renovation. UPVC spray painting is a much more long-term solution and lasts a lot longer than the other types of painting. 
 ### 4. UPVC Window Frame Wrap Costs 
 The vinyl you use in the process of wrapping your windows will require the best quality vinyl to meet the required expectations. However, a vinyl of this standard will be costly; very soon the costs of purchasing it by the roll begin to add up.  

 A single roll of the vinyl might cost hundreds of pounds and this does not include the other costs of labour in having to put it on your existing windows. 

 If you are planning to do the work yourself, one window might take anything between three to four hours to wrap. Thus, no matter how many of your windows are small, it will be greatly time-consuming and challenging to accomplish all of them.  

 If you are talking to a professional then of course, your quotes will be different. Remember the highest quality vinyl will only last up to 5 years. Spray paint, however, will stick on the UPVC windows and alter its colour for ten years, that’s a guaranteed statement.

 ### 5. The Cost of UPVC Window Spray Painting

 This is because painting UPVC windows with the spray painting approach is not as time-consuming for professional painters as it will for the vinyl process, leading to a significant cut on the amount of work to be done. The cost of materials is also significantly lower because professional painters will obtain their high-quality speciality paint from a store selling painting products and include the cost of the paint in the overall estimated price for the project. 

 The spray painting of your UPVC windows, on average, will cost you £150 per window. The best, cheapest, most long-lasting and most beautiful approach to painting your UPVC windows is through spraying.

 ### 2. Why Would You Need New Windows? 
 To be fair, when it comes to elevating your home’s curb appeal and aesthetic influence, as well as its resale value, there is nothing more effective in terms of exterior facade maintenance to that. As a result weathering, exposure and usage over time can cause your windows to seem discoloured, dull and flaky, compromising the appearance of your home and even its value. 

 The problem is many homeowners decide to spend the money for a complete window replacement. In addition to increasing the energy efficiency of your home and lowering your heating bills, it can also compensate for replacing your property's windows. 

 Whether or not you’re thinking of replacing a window, there are a lot of financial commitments involved and you need to look after these to ensure that the price you’re quoted is compatible with your budget. These include: 
* Frame style 
* Size and number of windows 
* Planning permission (if necessary) 
* Scaffolding (if necessary) 
* Installation costs 
* Materials used for the frame 
* Double vs triple glazing 

 The fact remains that windows can be spray painted, and it’s important to know that. If you only require changes or updating of your properties’ aesthetics or minor repairs, then this may just be for you if the need is not replacing your windows. 
 ### 3. The Size and Number of Windows to be Replaced 
 The more work there is the more the overall cost for the project will increase. But if you’re lucky enough to have a house that offers you a bigger property with a medium-sized window and so on, then you are guaranteed more. For example, terraced houses typically have 6-8 windows, semi-detached 10-20, and with detached properties anything from 10 up to over 30 windows. 
 ### 4. Type of Material for Replacement Windows 
 The number and dimensions of your windows will affect the cost of a window replacement: as will how your windows are framed. UPVC, uPVC casement windows, aluminium windows, aluminium frames and timber are all available to choose from. The cost is also determined by the number of glazing. 

 However, materials such as aluminium or metal are in between timber and UPVC and the latter is usually cheapest. For example, replacing a 1200 x 1200 mm uPVC window with aluminium is an upper estimate of about £900, the figure rising to £1000 and as high as £1500 with timber.

 ### 5. Style, Colour and Finish 
 Window replacements are not just about giving your home a new aesthetic, because there are several window styles, finishes and colours to choose from, and each will affect the amount you’re going to pay. 

 Windows come in many different styles and some are less expensive than others. Plain and leaded glass, casement, dual turn, bay, sash or bow windows are available. Casement windows are generally worth £500-£1250, while sash and bay windows cost 50% and 100% more than this. 

 In addition, some colours and finishes will cost more than others. White is the cheapest of the colours available with UPVC and variations will cost more or less depending on availability and application. 
 ### 6. Look for a Transparent and Accurate Quote 
 You want to choose a supplier that is both transparent and comprehensive with their breakdown of the total cost that you’ll be paying so that you aren’t surprised by any hidden or unexpected costs. When you receive a quote or an estimation for your window replacement, it would be worthwhile to keep a checklist for the following things: 
* While it covers almost all aspects of property management, the first is a complete technical property survey. 
* Frames size, style and colour 
* Materials used for the frame 
* Fitted type of glass 
* Glass window energy rating. 
* Handles, window cloths and fixtures 
* Installation costs 
* Disposal of old windows.

When it comes to weighing out the cost, it does make sense to think and consider every factor because it will help you get an approximate estimation in your head so that you will know how much to pay when they come telling you how much they want to work for.

 ### 1. What Is UPVC? 
 UPVC has gained much popularity in the market as a modern building material especially when constructing and or renovating homes and business premises especially when constructing or renovating doors and windows. 

 It has turned out to be an ideal substitute for timber because of the characteristic features which include an immensely long life cycle and flexibility to many uses/ applications. ![](/assets/door.png) 
 ### 2. What Paint is UPVC Paint? 
 As for the UPVC Paint which we have created and also the one which we use is an acrylic solvent-based paint. This is a liquid-based paint that comprises some principal ingredients: Polymeric dispersing phase (resin-binders), pigments, diminishing agents and additives. 
 ### 3. What is Acrylic Paint 
 Acrylic Paint is an emulsion based painting made of pigment, acrylic polymer and water solvents. It is therefore harder to water and is not easily derailed by the presence of moisture. 
 ### 4. What is Solvent-Based Paint? 
  **Introduction:** Solvent based paints or solutions The nature of the solvent based paints Certain features of the solvent based paints. 
* Solvent based paints are of organic solvents The solvent based paints are organic compound based paints. The organic compounds make the setting very hard and they increase it’s abrasion resistance hence it does not scratch easily. 
* Solvent based paints are relatively more viscous, and other substances, normally mineral spirits, have to be diluted with it before it can be applied on a surface. 
* The organic compounds in solvent based Paint react with oxygen chemically and as such evaporates. 
* Normally, the flow of air over a solvent-based paint will cause the reaction to be faster which in turn will help to bring down the drying periods. 
 ### 5. Why is UPVC Paint Different? 
 UPVC Paint has been developed uniquely for the use on plastic. Hence, it can be used on different types of the most rigid or hard such as PVC, polycarbonate, acrylic and polyester and uPVC. 

 The right paint for uPVC must be used since any other paint does not work as they do not stick well to smooth surfaces. Due to this, the finish produce will not be satisfactory, and the Paint will start to peel and crack. 
 ### Plastic Composition 
 An important characteristic of plastic it that they can expand and shrink due to fluctuations in temperature. That is, UPVC Paint can stretch and contract in these movements, thus making it last much longer than most other paint types. 

 In addition we have considered that uPVC has a non-porous skin therefore requires a Paint formula that will adhere to the surface without penetration as happens with wooden surfaces. 
 ### 6. Certified UPVC Paint 
 The paint has been developed to be non-aggressive and UV stabilised, loved-odour and highly saturated polyurethane Paint most working professional prefer it because it can stick to UPVC. 

 Expert painters will only work with paint that has been through all tests and meetings with assessment standards. These Paints will also have received an ISO rating to ensure that they have revealed how well they bond and their extent of lasting. 
 ### 7. How is UPVC Paint used? 
 UPVC Paint has to be applied only in an approved manner, otherwise it will not be as effective. Another important aspect that the formation of the surface that will be sprayed is also very important. 
 ### Applicator  
 Following these measurements, we employ an airless system to paint spraying and other coatings at high pressures using a spray gun. It also gives an even and minimum thickness which gives a good and smooth appearance. 
 ### Thinners 
 UPVC Paint is thick and needs thinners to be added in order to make it to form a workable solution that can be applied smoothly on the desired substrate surface. 
 ### Hardener 
 We also add a paint hardener. This is sodium polyacrylate, which is a crystallized salt product Sodium polyacrylate crystallized 7 By doing this, then proceed to throw water on the Paint where the salt quickly draws moisture out and turns the Paint into a hard rubber-like material. 
 ### Accelerator 
 However, we paint with the help of an accelerator. This additive is used in small quantities which aids in the hardener speed during the curing stage. 
 ### Finish 
 The resin element in the formulated Paint once solvents begin to evaporate (or paint begins to dry) produces a hard, durable coating. 
 ### 8. What UPVC Paint Should I Buy? 
 UPVC should only be painted using paints designed for that purpose. Good thing there are so many brands, but inevitably they will vary in both their quality. 

 As a customer, it is of course impossible for you to try each brand out there to see if one is truly the best. Therefore it may be that you Paint, and it’s perfect to begin with. However, as time went on it started to fade, peel and crack due to it being just not good enough.

 ### Can I Spray UPVC Myself? 
 In this case, you might be tempted to paint or spray part of the home to save some cash. However, here are some essential variables which you should factor into any decisions you make: 
* Only professional painters use upgraded gears and special kinds of paints, all of which cannot be bought cheaply and most of which can only be utilized by someone skilled in the field. 
* Regardless of having the proper tools and the RIGHT equipment, it is actually rather difficult to get that perfect smoothness. 

 The high-performance electric paint sprayer we use has an unusual nozzle arrangement. Our current spray paint setup is the best we’ve tested yet, and we’ve tested hundreds of spray paint machines. It helps us to get the PERFECT UPVC spray painting process. 
 ### Our Technique 
 We spray paint UPVC from top to bottom, or from one side to the next if the UPVC is horizontal. This prevents running. That is, we apply three coats of paint, each just a little thicker than the last one. The first coat would be more of a ‘dusting’ than a covering. The second is to blend in the first. The last of the three coats is the most important, because it determines how well done your finish will be. Here anything that fails is going to show up in the sun. 
 ### The Finishing Touches 
 We aren’t finished yet! If the windows or doors have had a color change we will reseal them to match. Afterwards, we carried out an extreme quality check of the work we performed ourselves. On a rare occasion, the areas we’ve sprayed need extra work. Still, if we catch them we fix them to get the perfect finish. We turn around 90 per cent of projects from start to finish in a day. This means that in addition to being thorough, our UPVC spray painting process is very efficient.`,image:"/assets/blog-04.png"},{id:13,title:"Spray Painting Courses for Sale and Franchise.",author:"James Harper",date:"5 May, 2023",category:"February 20, 2024",tags:["air conditioner"],excerpt:"We offer a Nationwide service, UK-wide with a proven and unique model of sharing our efforts and rewards with franchisees who are local business people.

",content:`![](/assets/efficient.png) 
 All of us need to realize that we need to find efficient and sustainable ways to cater for this in our way of doing things each day. 

 One of the most significant challenges is protecting the environment in this 21st century. The growth of the industry is unprecedented and the growing consumer demands have put an enormous environmental load on the planet. 

 It's this that's seeing businesses and consumers start to introduce some measure of sustainability into their decision-making more and more. 

 Indeed, the demand for sustainability has never been higher, and we can all start doing our part by taking a closer look at our options and the choices that we make. 
 ### 1. Efficient Homes 
 Your uPVC doors and windows will be in constant use and changing seasons year after year. The result is, that scratches and etches appear, the colours fade away and its aesthetic appeal drops dramatically. 

 At this point, you might think of replacing your uPVC, as expensive-looking and weathered uPVC devalues as much of your property as it shows. 

 In most cases though, your doors and windows are still operating just fine. The main benefit of uPVC though will be that as an incredibly durable and long-lasting material, your uPVC doors and windows will last for decades at a time. 

 The strength of your home against the cold is increased by having double-glazing windows and triple-glazing windows. Consequently, once you replace your windows with uPVC there is usually no reason to replace your original uPVC doors. ![](/assets/efficient-1.png) 
 ENERGY EFFICIENT HOMES 
 ### A Sustainable Solution 
 Living in excessive consumption, even if you don't need it. However, in this situation, you would not have to replace the entire uPVC elements in your home. 

 Repainting is a great way to repurpose parts of your home and waste less without losing out on any outcomes at all; all with minimal environmental impact. ![](/assets/efficient-2.png)

 ### 3. Are Paints Eco-Friendly? 
 Either way, those are what environmentalism and sustainability are all about — making choices and decisions which, ultimately, reduce our environmental footprint to a minimum. Unfortunately, many conventional household stuff contains bad chemicals and toxic compounds that damage the environment. 
 ### 4. VOCs - Volatile Organic Compounds 
 Formaldehyde, and plastics included under the name of Volatile Organic Compounds, are contained in many paints. These VOCs are released into the air and then continue to release these VOCs for up to five years after the paint has dried. 

 Limits and regulations have been made by the European Union and are in place to decrease the VOCs in household products. But the reality is, that those zero VOC levels of these VOCs would not be possible since these paints are such complex substances.  

 Certain manufacturers are working to create greener formulations. But there’s no precise definition of what makes one painting more or less sustainable than another. However, there are ways that painting can be made more sustainable finally. 
 ### 5. Consider Repainting Instead of Replacing 
 The environmental impact of replacing your uPVC windows and doors is far higher than the VOC emissions of the acrylic paints themselves. 

 Additionally, uPVC is produced with a large amount of carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere and when you take packaging and distribution off, that’s not even factored in. But if uPVC is used properly, it’s one of the most sustainable construction materials on offer today. 

 Using uPVC may not be as simple as popping it into your general waste bin, but it shouldn’t ever end up in your bin if you can help it either. Painting your uPVC will not affect its energy-saving or efficiency aspects. Therefore, instead of replacing it, you need to repaint it periodically whenever it is necessary.

 ### 6. An Alternative to Window and Door Replacements 
 Spraying painting your uPVC doors and windows isn’t because it looks good but can also help the actual material live longer. You're guaranteed a minimum of 10 years on all paintwork. 

 Spray painting uPVC results in a fraction of the emissions a traditionally made uPVC door or window makes and spray painting uPVC is always going to be the better option.

 ### 7. What Can Businesses Do? 
 Sustainability tries to take care of the critical problems and the critical issues in a business that are sometimes ignored. I tried to turn them around so the environment and community were at a benefit and not stripped of their resources and created business practices that give something back to those around me.  

 Sustainable business in essence means a business that makes an effort to develop policies and structures that guarantee minimum possible environmental impact. It's fundamental to continually seek new ways that you can do this.

 Reducing the impact we have on the earth without sacrificing quality is what we’re committed to. For instance, we aim to put eco-friendly practices into effect as soon as we can. This has led us to completely cut our consumption of the scarce resources we have and reuse recycled materials. 

 As standard within our company, we have implemented a range of eco-friendly initiatives. For example, we need a lot of masking paper/protection paper for our projects, which is recycled and sourced from sustainable and eco-friendly suppliers. 

 We do not only buy and only use old clothes, that would otherwise be discarded, as rags. Not only that, but we’re not using aerosols so there are no worries that the can can’t be recycled and then end up in a landfill.

 So replacing a single standard white uPVC window in the region of 900mm x 1200mm (or roughly 7ft by 13ft) will set you back on average between £400 and £600. You should be prepared to pay another 10-15% extra for black uPVC windows fitted.You also need to think about labour costs, build works and installation time. 
 ### Method 2 
 The cost of hand painting your uPVC windows. By far the cheapest option is hand-painting your uPVC windows black. However, it would help if you considered: 
* how long it would take to finish 
* some things you need to do before painting?

We also give no colour fading for 5 years."},{title:"7. What kind of paint do you use to paint uPVC?",answer:"With UPVC you have a non porous surface which means you need to use paint that will adhere to the surface and not get absorbed or penetrated by it as wood does. UPVC paints are normally quite thick. Using good quality paints everything would usually have to be thinned out before spraying. Popular paints because the solvents in the paints evaporate in the air and the paints harden onto the uPVC as a solid rather than cover up as a layer. Our paint is a ‘2 pack paint’ so you add hardener to the paint and bring it to life allowing a firm adhesion. The paints you choose matter – any job that is even half finished would be great at first but over time will begin to show defects and problems. Here is list of UK’s 3 Top Leading Paints."},{title:"8.
